# PeopleRegister
## Assumption 
  The date of birth ignores the time parametes. So if two children are born in a same date, only one name will be returened.
## For API design advice 
PeopleRegister.yml swagger file has been created. So the API and schema structure can be seen using https://editor.swagger.io.
